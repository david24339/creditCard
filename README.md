# creditCard
## Description
Have you ever used a credit or debit card? If not, you have probably seen one. Those cards are way more than plastic. From saving money to making purchases, they are really important in today's society. creditCard is a Python program that verifies whether a card number is valid. If valid, the program will display the card network (VISA, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover cards).In fact, many banks use a similar approach before allowing any transaction by card. This program has been implemented using Luhnâ€™s algorithm.
